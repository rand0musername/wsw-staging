            <ul>
            <li> The most promising line of LLM watermarking schemes (<img class="intext" src="static/images/intext/water.png">) works by altering the outputs of the LLM based on unique <i>watermark rules</i>. These rules are determined by the secret key <img class="intext" src="static/images/intext/xi.png"> known only to the server. Without secret key knowledge, the watermarked text looks unremarkable, but with it, the server can detect the unusually high usage of so-called <span class="green">green tokens</span>, mathematically proving that a piece of text was watermarked. Recent work posits that these schemes may be ready for deployment, but we provide evidence for the opposite.
            <li> We show that a malicious attacker (<img class="intext" src="static/images/intext/devil.png">) with only API access to the watermarked model, and a budget of under $50 in ChatGPT API costs, can use benign queries to build an approximate model (<img class="intext" src="static/images/intext/knowledge.png">) of the secret watermark rules used by the server. The details of our automated stealing algorithm are thoroughly laid out in <a href="https://files.sri.inf.ethz.ch/website/papers/jovanovic2024watermarkstealing.pdf">our paper</a>.
            <li> After paying this one-time cost the attacker effectively reverse-engineered the watermark, and can now mount arbitrarily many realistic <span class="devilish">spoofing and scrubbing attacks</span> with no manual effort, which destroys the practical value of the watermark.

          <ul>
            <li> In a realistic <span class="devilish">spoofing attack</span> the attacker generates high-quality text on arbitrary topics, which is confidently detected as <span class="green">watermarked</span> by the detector. This should be impossible for parties that do not know the secret key.
            <li> A <span class="devilish">spoofing attack</span> applied at scale discredits the watermark, as the server is unable to distinguish between truly watermarked and spoofed texts. Further, releasing harmful/toxic texts that are falsely attributed to a specific LLM provider at scale can lead to severe reputational damage.
            <li> We demonstrate reliable spoofing of a state-of-the-art scheme <span class="textsc">KGW2-SelfHash</span>, previously thought to be safe. Our attacker combines the previously built approximate model of watermark rules (<img class="intext" src="static/images/intext/knowledge_full.png">) with an open-source LLM, to produce high-quality texts that are detected as <span class="green">watermarked</span> with <b>over 80% success rate</b>. This works equally well when producing harmful texts, even when the original model is well aligned to refuse any harmful prompts.
            <li> We show some examples below, and in our <a style="color: #3273dc;" href="https://files.sri.inf.ethz.ch/website/papers/jovanovic2024watermarkstealing.pdf">rigorous evaluation</a> demonstrate similar success across several other schemes, study how our attack scales with query cost, and show success in the setting where the attacker paraphrases existing (<span class="red">non-watermarked</span>) text.

          <ul>
            <li> In a <span class="devilish">scrubbing attack</span> the attacker removes the watermark, i.e. tweaks the <span class="green">watermarked</span> server response in a quality-preserving way, such that the resulting text is <span class="red">non-watermarked</span>. If scrubbing is viable, misuse of powerful LLMs can be concealed, making it impossible to detect malicious use cases such as plagiarism or automated spamming and disinformation campaigns.
            <li> Researchers have studied the threat of <span class="devilish">scrubbing attacks</span> before, concluding that current state-of-the-art schemes are robust to this threat for sufficiently long texts. 
            <li> We challenge that conclusion. Our watermark stealing attacker can apply its partial knowledge of the watermark rules (<img class="intext" src="static/images/intext/knowledge_full.png">) to significantly boost the success rate of scrubbing on long texts with no need for additional queries to the server. Notably, we boost scrubbing success <b>from 1% to 85%</b> for the <span class="textsc">KGW2-SelfHash</span> scheme. Similar results are obtained for several other schemes, as we show in our experimental evaluation in <a style="color: #3273dc;" href="https://files.sri.inf.ethz.ch/website/papers/jovanovic2024watermarkstealing.pdf">the paper</a>. Below, we also provide several examples.
            <li> Our results challenge the common belief that robustness to <span class="devilish">spoofing attacks</span> and <span class="devilish">scrubbing attacks</span> are at odds for current schemes. On the contrary, we demonstrate that any vulnerability to watermark stealing enables <span class="devilish">both attacks</span> at levels much higher than previously thought.

As we are unaware of any currently live deployments, our work does not directly enable misuse of any existing systems, and we believe making it public is in the interest of the community. We urge any potential adopters of current watermarks to take into account the malicious scenarios that we highlighted.
            <li><img class="intext-big" src="static/images/intext/go.png"> <b>LLM watermarking remains promising, but more work is needed.</b> Our results do not imply that watermarking is a lost cause. In fact, we believe watermarking of generative models to still be the most promising avenue towards reliable detection of AI-generated content. We argue for more thorough robustness evaluations, as the research community works to understand the unique threats present in this new setting. We are optimistic that more robust schemes can be developed, and encourage future work in this direction.

            This first example shows a <span class="devilish">spoofing attack</span> on a prompt from the <span class="textsc">Dolly</span> dataset. Our attacker can generate high-quality responses to arbitrary prompts, that are detected as <span class="green">watermarked</span> (<i>to see this, turn on the watermark detector</i>), nullifying the key value proposition of the watermark. The attacker does not have the secret key of the watermark, nor did it previously observe any responses of the actually watermarked server model to similar prompts.

            LLM watermarking has attracted attention as a promising way to detect AI-generated content, with some works suggesting that current schemes may already be fit for deployment.
            In this work we dispute this claim, identifying <b>watermark stealing</b> (WS) as a fundamental vulnerability of these schemes.
            We show that querying the API of the watermarked LLM to approximately reverse-engineer a watermark enables practical <b>spoofing attacks</b>, as suggested in prior work, but also greatly boosts <b>scrubbing attacks</b>, which was previously unnoticed.
            We are the first to propose an automated WS algorithm and use it in the first comprehensive study of spoofing and scrubbing in realistic settings.
            We show that for <b>under $50 an attacker can both spoof and scrub state-of-the-art schemes</b> previously considered safe, with average success rate of over 80%.
            Our findings challenge common beliefs about LLM watermarking, stressing the need for more robust schemes.
